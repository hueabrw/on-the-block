# team_repo
A repository for a CWEB1130 team


# Branches

  * Production - this branch is the final product. It should be fully tested and free of bugs.
  * Release - This branch is where we stage for Production, making sure that all new features that were added are fully intergrated without bugs and function with the rest of the web app. Only after all testing is done and everyone agrees that this branch has been properly staged do we push this branch to Production.
  * Development - 
  * codys-branch
  * anas-branch
  * abes-branch

### Other Branches (can be deleted)

  * hotfix
  * feature
 
# Workflow Guidlines
 
  - Everyone works on their own branch
  - Once code is completed push to Development
  - Once Development has reached a milestone make a pull request to Release
  - Release is reviewed by entire team we push to Production
  - For communications we will use a Discord server
  - Everyone will use Visual Studio Code for their coding environment

### Workflow to Consider:

  - How do we want to deal with conflict?
  - Where do we want to keep our documentation? this repository? the project repository?
  - Do we want to use Azure DevOps?
  - Do we want to implement scrum?
