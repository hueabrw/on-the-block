# Workflow Guidlines
 
  - Everyone works on their own branch
  - Once code is completed push to Development
  - Once Development has reached a milestone make a pull request to Release
  - Release is reviewed by entire team we push to Production

### Workflow to Consider:

  - Communications tools : Discord? Slack?
  - Coding environment : VS Code?
  - Do we want to use Azure DevOps?
  - Do we want to implement scrum?
